# Health-Care-Analytics
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard designed to analyze patient waitlists, case types, and multi-year operational performance across healthcare specialties. The dashboard provides interactive insights into patient volumes, wait durations, age profiles, and specialty-level metrics.

## Overview
* This dashboard helps healthcare analysts and operations teams understand:
* Year-to-Date vs Last Year patient totals
* Case type distribution (Outpatient, Day Case, Inpatient)
* Median and average patient wait times
* Age-based and time-band segmentation
* Specialty-level performance metrics
* Multi-year trends of patient volumes
* Drill-down detailed reporting by date, age group, case type, and specialty

# Key Features
## 1. KPI Summary
Total patients this year vs previous year
Count of overall cases
Case breakdown displayed using a donut chart
## 2. Waitlist Key Indicators
Median and Average wait time toggle
Breakdown by Time Bands (0–3, 3–6, 6–9, 9–12, 12–15, 15–18 months)
Age_Profile segmentation (0–15, 16–64, 65+)
Highlights of specialty-level wait metrics
## 3. Time-Series Trends
Line charts displaying multi-year case trends
Separate views for:
Day Case & Inpatient combined
Outpatient trend analysis
## 4. Detailed Drill-Down View
Matrix table with full hierarchy:
Archive Date → Time Bands → Age Profile
Columns for Day Case, Inpatient, Outpatient, Total
Fully filterable through slicers:
Date Range
Speciality_Name
Case_Type

Time_Bands

## Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop
DAX (measures, calculations, toggles)
Power Query (data transformation & cleaning)
Excel/CSV source files (or database connections)

## Dashboard Capabilities
This dashboard helps answer key operational questions such as:
How do current waitlist volumes compare with previous years?
Which age groups are experiencing longer wait times?
Which specialties show higher median wait times?
Are inpatient/day case totals rising or declining?
What wait durations are most common across time bands?
